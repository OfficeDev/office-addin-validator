# Adding Self-Signed Certificates as Trusted Root Certificate

Office clients require add-ins and webpages to come from a trusted and secure location. This generator leverages [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) to start a web server, which requires a self-signed certificate. Your workstation will not trust this certificate and thus, the Office client, in which you are running your Office Add-in, will not load your add-in.

When you browse to a site that has an untrusted certificate, the browser will display an error with the certificate:

To fix this, you need to configure your developer workstation to trust the self-signed certificate. The steps for this differ depending on your developer environment (OSX / Windows / Linux). Use these instructions to trust the certificate:


## [OS X](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18677)

### Option #1: Bypassing the error in Chrome

choose the “Advanced” link, then choose “Proceed to local (unsafe)“.

You can locate the server.crt file at **~/your_yo_office_project/node_modules/browser-sync/lib/server/certs/server.crt**

#### Add certification file to Key Chain Access

1. Open the **Keychain Access** utility in OS X.
  1. Select the **System** option on the left.
  1. Click the lock icon in the upper-left corner to enable changes.

At this point everything has been configured. Quit all browsers, then reopen and try to navigate to the local HTTPS site. The browser should report it as a valid certificate:
